#### Introduction
Many factors affecting life expactancy have been studied in detail by stataticians through out history. One variable that
 has recently recieved mass attention is immunization. Reviewing past studies, it was determined that immunization was not 
 taken into account. These could range from Hepatitis B, Polio to Diphtheria, and many more. The data set studied includes data from 2000-2015 and varying countries. In order to simplify the analysis, 2014 is selected to be the sole year.
